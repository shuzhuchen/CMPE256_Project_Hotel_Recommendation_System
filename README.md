# CMPE256_Project_Hotel_Recommendation_System
This project focuses on developing a recommendation system for hotel reviews using three models: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF), and a Hybrid approach. A cluster-specific method was employed to group users and items into homogeneous subsets, improving prediction accuracy. Each model was evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and accuracy across multiple clusters.
